Overview
What is Kubernetes?
Kuberenets is an orchestrator for deploying containerized microservices.
Kubernetes Architecture
Master
master manages the cluster
It has for main components
kube-apiserver
cluster store
kube-controller-manager
kube-scheduler

Talk only with apiserver usually via kubelet command line utility. 
kubelet takes a yaml/json deployment file.
Nodes
kubelet: Main kubernetes agent on the node
container-runtime
kube-proxy
Declarative/desired state
Kubernetes works on the concept of declarative(vs iterative) state declaration
Pods
Atomic unit of work in Kubernetes
Pods cannot be shared across nodes. 
Pod is a ring-fenced environment with its own namespaces and filesystems, which means all containers in the pod share the same ip. 
We have to identify different conatiners via port mapping. 
Pods are created and dead. A pod is never restarted.
