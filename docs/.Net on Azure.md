# Developing with .NET on Microsoft Azure 

### Getting Started
-- Onprem - responsible for hardware, infrastructure and application  
-- IaaS - responsible only for infrastructure and application  
-- PaaS - responsible only for application  
-- Paas Service for .net apps is *AppServices*   
--- Monitoring and diagnostic tools for AppServices  
-- Cloud Databases:  
 --- Azure SQL Database: relational cloud db  
 --- DocumentDb store: NoSql cloud db(supports mongodb also)  
-- Cloud Storage:  
 ---Blob storage(  
     Block blob - most general for movies, images, etc. ,   
     Page blob - for writing/read middle of blob like disc on VMs,   
     Append blob - writing to end of blob like logging  
     )  
 ---Table storage  
 ---Queue storage  
 ---File Storage  
-- Azure Functions  
 ---Provides Serverless computing and Nano services support  
-- VSTS  
 --- VSTS helps to acheive CI and CD   

### Cloud Patterns and Architecture


# Building Secure Services and Applications
- Webhooks help to deploy the app from Docker Hub to Azure web app containers automatically

- Azure Resource Manager templates helps to automate the process of spinning up infrastructure
- Azure Resource Providers are the actual sources of provisioning resources
Resource Groups 
- tags help us to organise/group resources logically...ex prod, qa, dev
- Access Control provides roles/claim to users/groups/other resources
- Policies help to enforce rules at subscription/resource group level
- All the above help to use effectively manage and organize Azure resources
